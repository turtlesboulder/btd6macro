I used pulover's macro creator to make a macro that can play the expert tracks on BTD6. (Version 40 of the game)
My screen resolution is 1920 by 1080. If yours isn't that it probably won't work. 
The idea is to update this later to be able to automatically complete collection events. 

Assumes that the player's hero is Sauda, they are using the default keybinds, that auto-start is turned on, and that the player has a bunch of monkey knowledge, and that they have unlocked all the expert maps, etc. etc. etc. The free dart and extra starting cash should be the only critical MK. 

It should be able to tell when it has been defeated and will move on, so even if you don't have all these things it should win at least some time.

Pulover's macro creator is wonky and often the macro will play back at the wrong speed. I'm not sure how to resolve this.
